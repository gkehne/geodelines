#geodelines

This program draws randomly generated lines that squiggle down the page, but maintain a roughly uniform distance from one another. It does this by randomly drawing the first line, then drawing the next line to lie a certain distance away from it, and so on. It is inspired by the growth lines that appear in the cross-sections of geodes, the equal-altitude lines on topographical maps, and the work of artist Sol LeWitt, specifically "Wall Drawing 797": ![Wall Drawing 797](https://github.com/gkehne/geodelines/blob/master/Sol_LeWitt_797.jpg?raw=true)
