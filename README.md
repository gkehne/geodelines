#geodelines

This program draws randomly generated lines that squiggle randomly down the page, but maintain a roughly uniform distance from one another. It does this by randomly drawing the first line, then drawing the next line to lie a certain distance away from it, and so on. It is inspired by the growth lines that appear in the cross-sections of geodes, the equal-altitude lines on topographical maps, and the work of artist Sol LeWitt, specifically "Wall Drawing 797".
